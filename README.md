# Steak_Risk_Data


**Steak Risk Data**

Let me briefly explain why I chose this data to analyze, besides the fact that I love meat. 

The first time I saw the Steak Risk Dataset I was intrigued not only by the content but also by the creativity and cleverness of the pun between steak and risk. Something at stake means also something risky.

I am a big fan of meat myself, and as a good Brazilian, I enjoy a fine cut. In addition, is there anything more enjoyable than writing about food? Therefore, analyzing data about food would not be different.

As soon as I began to understand the data better, I started to define my hypothesis and then few questions arose:

Question 1ยบ: Do risk takers eat rarer steaks?
Question 2ยบ: How do men and women like their meat doneness?
Question 3ยบ: Do the richer people cheat more on their partners?
